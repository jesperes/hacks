- Usability issues -

* In general, difficult to get started...
* Prompt the user to define a runtime if one isn't found
* Erlang console visible by default
* Right-click on *.erl files (and other elements (functions, modules, etc.)) and select "Run/Debug as"
* How do I compile/run my code. Should not have to resort to console (the console
  should really not have to be used.)
* "Tracer" tab in erlang console not very useful, difficult to see contents of
  columns, unclear what it all means.
* Erlang console too cluttered (tabs, toolbar, split output/input view). Plain terminal is enough.
* Sender/leader button.
* No tooltips
* Process list view doesn't show anything unless "i" button is pressed. Should be automatic.
* Live expressions doesn't update ("rpc failed", but no further diagnostics)
* Process list view: sort on columns
* Syntax coloring doesn't show immediately. Neither does the outline view.
* Outline view shouldn't autoexpand children. I think.

- Improvements -

* Content-assist
* Refactoring

- Bugs -
* Clicking in outline view on a function selects, but selection doesn't really match the function.
