- Usability issues -

* In general, difficult to get started...
* Prompt the user to define a runtime if one isn't found
* Erlang console visible by default
* Right-click on *.erl files (and other elements (functions, modules, etc.)) and select "Run/Debug as"
* "Tracer" tab in erlang console not very useful, difficult to see contents of
  columns, unclear what it all means.
* Erlang console to cluttered (tabs, toolbar, split output/input view). Plain terminal is enough.
* Sender/leader button.
* No tooltips
* Process/list view doesn't show anything unless "i" button is pressed. Should be automatic.
* Live expressions doesn't update ("rpc failed", but no further diagnostics)

- Improvements -

* Syntax coloring
* Content-assist
* Outline view
* Refactoring
