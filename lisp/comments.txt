Comments on how high-speed-lisp.c works
=======================================

Uses a set of arrays of fixed size to store atoms, numbers, bindings, etc.

For example, the array car[] holds car-pointers. A cons-cell is
represented by an integer n. The cons-cell's car cell can be looked up
by car[n].

Function cons(long x, long y) returns a new free node and place x and y in it.


Lisp interpreter should without big problems be possible to fit onto a
Cortex-M board.
